# New IoT Denylist Classfiers

As discussed on recent IoT working group calls, Nova Labs has introduced two
new classifiers into the denylist.

## Ingest Latency Edge Classifier

The data gathered from the oracles contains information related to the observed
ingest latency when a hotspot witnesses another hotspot. In the POC pipeline we
create histograms of these observed ingest latencies.

The keys in the histogram correspond to the observed time-diff when the packet
was received by the destination hotspot and the values correspond to the number
of occurrences of the observed time-diff.

Below are two samples of such histograms:

![Latency Histogram 1](histogram1.jpeg)

This is an example of a "bad" latency histogram. No peaks, and very little below
4000/50 (80 on the x axis here).

![Latency Histogram 2](histogram2.jpeg)

This is an example of a "good" latency histogram. Strong and defined peak at
3400ms, which is the expected time for EU868.

To quantify and mathematically prove such outliers, we have the
following algorithm:

### Preparation

Make coarser buckets of keys and accumulate values such that the variance of
observed time-diff has lower impact on the algorithm to find the outliers.

For example, a time-diff of 3000, 3010, 3020 can be bucketed as 3000. Notice
that these times are 1/100th of a millisecond thus it's reasonable to make this
assumption and have some built-in tolerance.

### Rules 

 * If the number of observed samples is greater than 1 and the standard deviation
   of values (counts) is greater than or equal to 0.0 and the maximum observed
   time diff is less than or equal to 4000, we consider the ingest latency to be
   within bounds.
 * If the number of samples is exactly equal to 1 and the maximum observed time
   diff is less than or equal to 4000, we consider the ingest latency to be
   within bounds.
 * Anything else which doesn’t belong to the above two rules is considered a
   potential re-broadcaster.

We use the above rules to quantify whether an edge should be marked as
illegitimate or not.

## Antenna Splitter Hotspot Classifier

This classifier attempts to identify hotspots that are sharing an antenna.

Antenna splitting is never considered ok, so there’s an absolute maximum RSSI
we tolerate (currently set to 0).

This classifier requires these links to have these properties reciprocally, as
in the reverse link also has to exceed these thresholds.

The classifier records a list of hotspots that the hotspot is splitting with.
These are included in the report cards.

![Antenna splitter example](splitter1.jpeg)

A hotspot with positive RSSI values with multiple peers, asserted more than a
kilometer apart. This is very likely to be antenna splitting.


![Non-antenna splitter example](splitter2.jpeg)

A hotspot (in US915) with a much more typical RSSI/Distance plot.

We've currently been quite conservative with this classifier. In the future we
intend to extend it to also cover hotspots that are in the same room/building
but are asserted significant distances apart.

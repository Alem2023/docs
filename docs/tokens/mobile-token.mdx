MOBILE is the protocol token of the [Helium Mobile Network][mobile]. MOBILE was introduced to the
Helium Network through the community proposal [HIP-53][hip-53] and is further defined in subsequent
HIPs<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]<sup>)</sup>.

[^1]: [HIP-70: Scaling the Helium Network][hip-70]
[^2]: [HIP-75: MOBILE PoC - Initiate Programmatic Minting][hip-75]
[^3]: [HIP-77: Solana Parameters][hip-77]

The MOBILE token is mined by 5G Hotspots through both data transfer proceeds as well as Proof of
Coverage.

The mint address for MOBILE is [`mb1eu7TzEc71KxDpsmsKoucSSuuoGLv1drys1oP2jh6`][mobile-mint-addr] on
the Solana blockchain.

## Redemption for HNT

Protocol tokens like MOBILE will always be backed by HNT and will convert to HNT. To enable this,
each network within the Helium Network is allocated a pool of HNT based on the Network Utility
Score. The redemption ratio is set algorithmically by the treasury swap contacts based on this
Network Utility Score.

The [Helium Wallet App][wallet-app] serves as the primary platform for exchanging MOBILE to HNT.
This transaction can also be performed directly through the Solana blockchain using the open-source
tooling found in the [Helium GitHub repositories][github].

## Token Allocation

MOBILE follows a similar minting schedule to HNT, however at a max supply of 230,000,000,000 (230B).
50B MOBILE were pre-mined at the launch of the Mobile Network and distributed to the Network
operations fund administered by the Helium Foundation. A fraction of this allocation was distributed
throughout the Genesis period to live Mobile Network Hotspots. Year 1 for MOBILE started on August
1st, 2022.

The issuance is scheduled to have halvings every 2 years, aligning with HNT issuance halvings.

The emission schedule was created in [HIP-53][hip-53-emissions], updated in
[HIP-75][hip-75-emissions]and confirmed in [HIP-77][hip-77-emissions] and is as follows:

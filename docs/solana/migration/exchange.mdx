# Exchange Migration

Helium will be transitioning from its own L1 to Solana. The proceedure for Helium should be the same
as the proceedure for all other Solana SPL Tokens.

All the tokens are on the `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` program.

<!-- TODO: Mint ids -->

These mint IDs exist both on `mainnet-beta` and `devnet`, so you can test.

# Exchange Migration

Helium will be transitioning from its own L1 to Solana. The proceedure for Helium should be the same
as the proceedure for all other Solana SPL Tokens.

All the tokens are on the `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` program.

The mint IDs are as follows:

| Name | ID |
|------|----|
| HNT | hntv1Vf5ZBG777xAHqHUTFS8UZBTNUN22MBnYramPFk |
| MOBILE | mb1eaxqRn3VMUuA9MC1hXiNFG7hnJHfF8Cvq7vfYH4y |
| IOT | iotfeTXUVZKZvmFCTTHrgmep94seQJurjvMgKuqpHyx |
| DC | dc5Zu977Zan2BFt7iLxCCUoyPvxpxZGYK23d6GYZXq7 |

These mint IDs exist both on `mainnet-beta` and `devnet`, so you can test.

## Wallet Migration

To migrate wallet(s) to Solana, you can use the migration service. Instead of sending all transactions
to inflate helium state on Solana during the transition period, transactions are instead processed as needed.
When a user opens their wallet in the helium wallet app, it requests our migration service to get the
needed transactions, then submits them to Solana.

Since exchange wallets may not use the wallet app, you can use the service directly:

For devnet:

`https://migration.web.test-helium.com/migrate/*solana-wallet-address*?limit=1000&offset=0`

This will get the list of serialized transactions, which should be sent to Solana.

To get the Solana wallet address from a helium wallet address, call:

`https://migration.web.test-helium.com/helium/*helium-wallet-address*`

You can also use our command line utility from [here](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/releases/tag/v0.0.27-migration-cli)

```
$ env MIGRATION_SERVICE_URL=https://migration.web.test-helium.com env SOLANA_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com env SOLANA_WSS_URL=wss://api.devnet.solana.com ./migration-tx-executor --wallet *your-solana-wallet*
```

You can see typescript code demonstrating how to use this [here](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/blob/master/packages/migration-service/src/test-submit.ts#L37)

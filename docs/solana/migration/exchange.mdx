:::warning ðŸš§ This document is a work in progress. ðŸš§

The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

:::

Helium will be transitioning from its own L1 to Solana. The proceedure for Helium should be the same
as the proceedure for all other Solana SPL Tokens.

All the tokens are on the `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` program.

The mint IDs are as follows:

| Name   | ID                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| HNT    | hntyVP6YFm1Hg25TN9WGLqM12b8TQmcknKrdu1oxWux |
| MOBILE | mb1eu7TzEc71KxDpsmsKoucSSuuoGLv1drys1oP2jh6 |
| IOT    | iotEVVZLEywoTn1QdwNPddxPWszn3zFhEot3MfL9fns |
| DC     | dcuc8Amr83Wz27ZkQ2K9NS6r8zRpf1J6cvArEBDZDmm |

These mint IDs exist both on `mainnet-beta` and `devnet`, so you can test.

## Wallet Migration

To migrate wallet(s) to Solana, you can use the migration service. Instead of sending all
transactions to inflate helium state on Solana during the transition period, transactions are
instead processed as needed. When a user opens their wallet in the helium wallet app, it requests
our migration service to get the needed transactions, then submits them to Solana.

Since exchange wallets may not use the wallet app, you can use the service directly:

For devnet:

`https://migration.web.test-helium.com/migrate/*solana-wallet-address*?limit=1000&offset=0`

This will get the list of serialized transactions, which should be sent to Solana.

To get the Solana wallet address from a helium wallet address, call:

`https://migration.web.test-helium.com/helium/*helium-wallet-address*`

You can also use our command line utility from
[here](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/releases/tag/v0.0.27-migration-cli)

```
$ env MIGRATION_SERVICE_URL=https://migration.web.test-helium.com env SOLANA_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com env SOLANA_WSS_URL=wss://api.devnet.solana.com ./migration-tx-executor --wallet *your-solana-wallet*
```

You can see typescript code demonstrating how to use this
[here](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/blob/master/packages/migration-service/src/test-submit.ts#L37)

## Trustless Wallet Migration

While the above tools are convenient, they rely on our migration service. Luckily, the on-chain
implementation of the migration is trustless. The full state of the helium chain was converted to a
list of Solana transactions and then compressed into a merkle root on Solana. This means that anyone
can execute the transactions to inflate a wallet so long as they provide a proper proof that the
provided transactions are valid. Each transaction is only allowed to be executed once.

We can see one such transaction here:

If you would like a copy of the database serving the proofs for the migration service, please
contact the helium foundation. You can then run your own instance of the
[migration service](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library/tree/master/packages/migration-service)

# Governance Migration

After the migration, [Helium Vote](https://helium.vote) will transition to using Solana SPL Governance Realms.

While the user interface will change, the governance process will remain mostly the same.

Using the Helium Black Wallet App, you will be able to use an embedded browser to visit helium.vote, connect your wallet, and vote yes/no 
on proposals. If you have a Ledger, or any other Solana wallet, you can navigate to the website, connect your wallet, and vote.

## Governance Changes

The major change with Solana governance is that more of the helium network can be governed by the DAO.

Everything from Program (smart contract) changes to approving makers can now controlled by the DAO.

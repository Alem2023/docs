As an application builder on top of Helium, many of the APIs and interfaces are changing. 

If you are building against hotspots, token accounts, or anything blockchain related, you should start with

If you are building against the Proof of Coverage datasets, you should read through [Oracle Data](/solana/oracle-data)

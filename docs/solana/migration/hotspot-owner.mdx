:::warning ðŸš§ This document is a work in progress. ðŸš§

The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

:::

As a hotspot owner, you will not need to do anything for the migration. You do not need to power
your Hotspot off, you can leave it on and we'll do the rest!

If you use the Helium Wallet App (Black App), you will see it enter a "transitioning" state during
the 24 hour downtime of the migration. Once the transition is over, you can open the app again, and
after a minute or so you should see all of your assets and hotspots.

## Reward Distribution

If you own a LoRaWAN hotspot, you will now receive IOT tokens as mining rewards instead of HNT.

On Solana, rewards accumulate to the hotspot and must be claimed. You can claim as often as you
would like, keeping in mind that for every claim you pay a small transaction fee in SOL, that as of
writing this is a fraction of a cent.

## Hotspot owners with 50+ hotspots

If you own a large number of hotspots, it may take up to 48 hours after the migration to see all
hotspots in your app.

Because claiming is an explicit action now, you may want to enlist a service to claim rewards on all
of your hotspots.

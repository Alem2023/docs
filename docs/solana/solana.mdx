# Introduction

As of [HIP-70, Scaling the Helium Network](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0070-scaling-helium.md)
helium is moving to the Solana blockchain. These docs are for anyone developing directly against
the Helium programs on the Solana Blockchain

## Programs

The code for all of these programs is open source, and available in [helium-program-library](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library)

These contracts (TODO: Not yet, when it's done link to audit report) have been audited by Sec3.

| Name | Program ID | Description |
-------|-------------|----------------
| lazy_distributor | 1azyuavdMyvsivtNxPoz6SucD18eDHeXzFCUPq5XU7w | Allows off-chain oracles to distribute PoC rewards to rewardable assets (like hotspots) that are represented as NFTs. |
| helium_sub_daos | hdaoVTCqhfHHo75XdAMxBKdUqvq1i5bF23sisBqVgGR | Manages the DAO/SubDAO structure proposed in HIP-51, including the minting of tokens to subdaos, HST holders, and the `lazy_distributor` for PoC earnings. |
| data_credits | credMBJhYFzfn7NxBMdU4aUqFggAjgztaCcv2Fo6fPT | Manages the purchase, delegation, and burning of data credits. |
| helium_entity_manager | hemjuPXBpNvggtaUnN1MwT3wrdhttKEfosTcc2P9Pg8 | Handles the issuance of NFTs representing entities that are rewardable on the Helium network, like hotspots and mappers. |
| circuit_breaker | circAbx64bbsscPbQzZAUvuXpHqrCe6fLMzc2uKXz9g | Generic program wrapping sensitive mint authorities and token accounts in the Helium system to prevent large movements in the case of an exploit or bug. |
| treasury_management | treaf4wWBBty3fHdyBpo35Mz84M8k3heKXmjmi9vFt5 | Mangages the treasury of each SubDAO as proposed in HIP-51, allowing DNT tokens to be swapped for HNT according to a formula. |
| voter_stake_registry | hvsrNC3NKbcryqDs2DocYHZ9yPKEVzdSjQG6RVtK1s8 | Handles voting power via veHNT in Helium Governance.
| lazy_transactions | 1atrmQs3eq1N2FEYWu6tyTXbCjP4uQwExpjtnhXtS8h | Used in the initial migration to Solana, this program allows compressing many transactions into a merkle root to be executed lazily. This guarentees all txs are executed exactly once. |

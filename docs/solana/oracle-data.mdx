The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

The Helium Network operates Oracles that perform various tasks backing Proof of Coverage and data
transfer for the LoRaWAN (IoT), Mobile, and any future networks. These Oracles provide extensive
logs for the purposes of analysis of the Helium subDAOs.

The Helium Oracles handle all data about the network with the exception of transactions handled by
the [Helium Program Libraries](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library) on Solana.

<!--TODO: break out all the data for each, What is the bucket, what data is in each  -->

## Accessing Oracle Data

### AWS S3 Buckets

Data is directly accessible from the following buckets in AWS `us-west-2`. All data provided in
these S3 buckets is provided on a basis of 'Requestor Pays'. For more information on accessing data
from these buckets, refer to
[Downloading objects in Requester Pays buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html).

The bucket policies include the `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` actions so execution of AWS CLI
commands such as `aws s3 ls`, `aws s3 cp`, and `aws s3 sync` will work. Example commands provided
below:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://<source_bucket_name>/historical/ --request-payer
```

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://<source_bucket_name>/historical/ s3://<dest_bucket_name>  --recursive --request-payer
```

```bash
aws s3 sync s3://<source_bucket_name>/historical/ s3://<dest_bucket_name> --request-payer
```

Be mindful that AWS will charge you for:

1. Storage costs on any destination buckets.
2. Egress fees if the data leaves `us-west-2`.
3. `PUT`, `COPY`, `POST`, `LIST` requests. To that end, keeping data in `us-west-2` and using the
   **`aws s3 cp`** (rather than `aws s3 sync` command) will save you significant money.

   | BucketNames                         |
   | ----------------------------------- |
   | `foundation-iot-entropy-rp`         |
   | `foundation-iot-ingest-rp`          |
   | `foundation-iot-packet-ingest-rp`   |
   | `foundation-iot-packet-verifier-rp` |
   | `foundation-verified-rewards-rp`    |
   | `foundation-mobile-ingest-rp`       |
   | `foundation-mobile-verified-rp`     |

### Arweave

_**Planned:**_ In the interest of providing a decentralized option for data access all Oracle data
is additionally replicated to [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org). This provides a data access option
that does not require egress fees. Arweave implementation will be accompanied by relevant access
patterns.

## Reading Bytestream Data

In order to store the massive amount of data generated by the Oracles, the output is stored as
zipped bytestreams. In order to 'unpack' this data, you'll need the associated protobuf from
[github.com/helium/proto](https://github.com/helium/proto).

<!--TODO: list the specific protos used for each file type  -->

## Service Providers

Several Helium ecosystem companies are building interfaces around Oracle data. These services range
from APIs to Oracle data explorers

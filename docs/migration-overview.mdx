The Helium Network is migrating to the Solana blockchain, and this documentation site is updating in
real-time. Use this curated list of topics to learn about the impacts and what to expect from this
migration.

## Community & Discord

> The people of the People's Network.

- Efforts are underway to streamline the [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) experience for
  current and new members.
- Looking to learn more about Solana development? Checkout the
  [Solana Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/kBbATFA7PW)

## Community Developers

> The Solana migration is another step in taking heavier operations off chain and towards Light
> Hotspots.

- Get help and join the conversation on the [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium).
- Check out the `helium-program-library`
  [on Github](https://github.com/helium/helium-program-library).

## Console Users & LoRaWAN Roaming Partners

> The Open LNS initiative allows anyone looking to deploy devices on the Helium Network to use any
> LoRaWAN Network Server.

- [Read more](/lorawan-on-helium/open-lns) about the Open LNS Initiative.
- Learn more about [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/), an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server.

## Helium Blockchain & Console API Users

> The existing [Blockchain API](/api/blockchain/introduction) will halt with the Helium L1
> blockchain.

- Data will be available via Oracles, read more about [Oracles and Data Access here](/oracles).
- Data will be preserved, and efforts to maintain historical data are being evaluated.

## Helium Wallet CLI & Ledger CLI Users

> Wallets created with the wallet-cli, the ledger-cli, or from ledger devices will migrate to Solana
> but will be on a different derivation path.

- `wallet-cli`: The CLI Wallet will have its feature set pared down as there are many other
  Solana-compatible CLI Wallets. Read more
  [here](/solana/migration/wallet-user#for-cli-wallet-users).
- `ledger cli`: A ledger cli is being generated from a clone of the solana-cli app, but using he
  Helium derivation path. Read more [here](/solana/migration/wallet-user#for-ledger-wallet-users).

## Helium Improvement Proposal Voting

> The Solana ecosystem is full of tools to facilitate Governance.

- Improvement Proposal voting and other governance initiatives will be managed using
  [Realms](https://app.realms.today/discover).
- Voting will use Vote Escrow Tokens, read more
  [here](/mine-hnt/validators/validators-and-voting-power).

## Hotspot Makers

> Hotspot Makers will maintain their fleets and update Maker apps through the Solana migration.

- Development guides for Maker Apps are [available here](/solana/migration/maker).
- Makers with questions or in need of assistance should reach out
  [on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/1063168335367385268).

## Hotspot Operators

> No physical actions are required for Hotspots to migrate to the Solana blockchain. Though please
> be on the lookout for recommendations from individual Hotspot Makers.

- Read about what the migration means for Hotspot Operators
  [here](/solana/migration/hotspot-operator).

## Token Holders

> The migration to Solana will make all Helium Network tokens "SPL Tokens," enabling integrations
> within Solana DeFi platforms and unlocking more decentralized trading venues.

- Read about Heliun Network Tokens [here](/helium-tokens/hnt).
- Read more about SPL Tokens on the [Solana Documentation site](https://spl.solana.com/token).

## Validators & Validator Operators

> Validators will no longer operate on the Solana blockchain.

- As a reward for work done, Validators will recieve a share of the 2.5 billion IOT premine outlined
  in [HIP-52](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0052-iot-dao.md).

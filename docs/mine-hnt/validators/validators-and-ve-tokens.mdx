The Helium Foundation is making progress in implementing HIP 70 and migrating our L1 to Solana.
Check out the
[Solana Transition AMAs](https://twitter.com/HeliumFndn/status/1598361332520132608?s=20&t=a5g0_g0ctlBfqlgUPzmCMQ)
hosted on Twitter Spaces for the most up-to-date progress on the L1 transition.

Validators remain critical for the ongoing operation of the Helium Network and continue to earn HNT
rewards for their role in supporting the Helium ecosystem until the L1 transition is complete.

Validators currently maintain the network and provide vital operations, including issuing
challenges, validating transactions, and building blocks from which all network participants
benefit. One of the impacts of the passing of HIP 70 and transitioning L1 is that the role
Validators play will no longer be required, and Validators will be sunset by the end of Q1 2023
after the transition is complete.

Validators that remain staked receive new vote escrowed tokens (veHNT) based on their staked HNT
amount and their lock-up period. Post-migration, veHNT will be the only way to vote in the Helium
network. Holding veHNT means you, or your pool, has the opportunity to influence the future of the
network, and the more voting weight you have, the more influence you can use. Vote escrowed tokens
will be used to vote in DAO and subDAO governance and open a world of opportunities for on-chain
voting and voting power delegation.

## Key Take Aways

- Until the L1 transition is complete, staked Validators will continue to earn HNT rewards for block
  production.
- veHNT gives holders voting rights to determine the future of the Helium Network.
- Validator operators can decide to remain staked and receive veHNT or unstake and remain in
  cool-down until the completion of the L1 migration.
- Validators who remain staked receive a 3x veHNT bonus for staked HNT, and their HNT remains locked
  up for the minimum six-month period.
- veHNT holders will earn MOBILE or IOT tokens depending on which Helium subDAO they delegate their
  veHNT.
- After the minimum lockup period, HNT releases to the owner’s wallet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Is veHNT?

veHNT is the vote escrowed token of the native Helium token, HNT.

In the Helium ecosystem, HNT holders can receive veHNT by locking their HNT from further access for
a specified period in exchange for voting rights in the HeliumDAO
([HIP 51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336)) and other benefits, such as earning MOBILE or
IOT tokens. After the lock-up period ends, the locked up HNT releases to the owner’s wallet.

### What Was Staked HNT?

Following [HIP 25](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0025-validators.md), Validator operators
staked 10,000 HNT, or multiples of 10,000 HNT, into a Validator or Validator group. The work of
Consensus Group creation moved to the Validator node type as an incentive to becoming a Validator,
and shifting a yearly average of 6% of HNT per year was to Validator operators.

Validator Operators could vote on Helium HIPs with HNT in their wallet or with the HNT in their own
managed staked Validators. HNT holders who elected to partially stake with a Validator pool operator
were not able to decide personally on voting; instead, the pool operator controlled their voting
power.

### Benefits of Staking veHNT

After the Solana migration, stakers can use their staked veHNT to vote on proposals in the HeliumDAO
and help the DAO make collective decisions, influencing the future of the network.

Stakers will additionally be able to delegate veHNT to a subDAO for token rewards. Delegating veHNT
to a subDAO will count towards the DAO Utility Score, the ‘V’ value referenced in HIP 51. The higher
the DAO Utility Score, the higher the proportion of HNT sent the SubDAO treasury every epoch.

The staked return in subDAO tokens is about 4% but will vary based on the amount delegated per
subDAO.

### What Happens to HNT Previously Staked in a Pool?

Check with the vendor managing your staking pool for more detailed information about your staking
pool's decision.

:::warning

The Helium Foundation is neither responsible nor manages the status of Validator staking pools.

:::

If your unstake cooldown period started before the cooldown period was changed from 250,000 blocks
to 125,000 blocks and you have a cooldown date after the proposed date of HIP70 implementation, then
for any stake that has cooled down at least 125,000 blocks, the total stake will be released back to
the account owner.

For any Validator in a cooldown state with any stake (that has cooled down at least 125,000 blocks),
the total stake will be released back to the account owner.

### What Happens if I Unstake Today?

If you unstake today, the expected cooldown period is 125,000 blocks plus up to 30 blocks to the end
of the next epoch or approximately mid-February 2023, which is likely to be later than the
implementation of HIP 70.

Your HNT will convert to veHNT with a staking release date of 6 months from implementing the initial
HIP 70 block.

If you remain staked, your HNT will convert to veHNT with a 6-month staking lock-in period from the
same day of HIP70 implementation.

Your veHNT will receive a 3x Voting Weight multiplier during the 6-month lock-up as a reward for
staking in the network.

### Where Does My HNT Go if I Stake veHNT?

If you stake your HNT for veHNT, your HNT will go into a multi-sig wallet run by the Helium
Foundation. In exchange for your HNT, veHNT will deposit into your wallet.

At the end of the lock-up period, you will receive HNT back to your wallet 1:1 for the HNT you
staked.

### What is a “lock up” period?

You will incur a lock-up period when you stake your HNT for veHNT. The lock-up period is between 6
and 48 months with block granularity.

Lock-up periods help protect the network from malicious actors and are a security measure to
maintain the stability of the HNT to veHNT swap.

### What is Voting Power?

Voting power is the weight of your vote towards decisions made by the DAO or subDAO. The more veHNT
you have, the more weight your vote has.

You can only increase your voting power by staking more HNT or by extending an existing veHNT stake.

### How to Choose a subDAO to Stake?

[HIP 51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)
defines that all subDAOs return a maximum of 6% of their earnings to their veHNT delegators and is
designed to be an equal maximum reward level across all subDAOs so that no subDAO can buy their way
to a higher DAO Utility score.

Returns can be lower than 6% if the subDAO votes to provide a lower token return in return for other
benefits or similar.

As more HNT deposits in a subDAO's treasury, the DAO Utility Score improves, thus the subDAO's
Hotspot earnings value in HNT.

Stakers with no Hotspot ownership or who are not inclined to one particular subDAO will have to
decide to delegate based on the following:

- The value in HNT of the subDAOs token
- The quantities of HNT and subDAOs tokens in the subDAOs treasury
- The amount of veHNT already staked in the subDAO The current and anticipated Hotspot onboarding
  fees burned in the subDAO
- The anticipated data credits to be burned in the subDAO

A strong trend in the delegation of veHNT to one subDAO to increase the amount of HNT sent to that
subDAOs treasury will increase the amount of value of HNT sent to that treasury per epoch, but, as
more delegators are sharing that 6% return, the share of the 6% will be less.

### How can I Obtain veHNT?

Staking HNT for veHNT will be done on [Realms](https://dao-beta.mango.markets/realms). This is not
available today.

Check out a [DAO beta view](https://dao-beta.mango.markets/dao/MNGO) on Realms today.

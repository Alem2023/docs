import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

You can write content using [GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## Markdown Syntax

To serve as an example page when styling markdown based Docusaurus sites.

### Headers

Helium Documention useds H1, H2, and H3 tags.

- H4 tags are a _rare_ exception, likely an indicator that more sections are needed

```markdown
# H1 - Create the best documentation

## H2 - Create the best documentation

### H3 - Create the best documentation
```

---

### Emphasis

- Emphasis, aka italics, with _underscores_.
- Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks**.

---

### Lists

- list entries end in a period.
- Use numberd lists in the order matters.
- Use unordered lists when the order does not matter.

#### Ordered List

```markdown
1. First ordered list item
1. Another item
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
1. And another item.
```

#### Unordered List

```markdown
- Unordered lists use minuses
- the order of these items does not matter
```

---

### Links

Use "Reference-style" or "Inline-style" links only.

- is using reference-style links, include all links at the bottom of the page only.

```markdown
- [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com/)
- [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com/ "Google's Homepage")
- [I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org/
```

---

### Images

- below page front-matter include `import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'` to shorted image
  reference paths.
- Use "Inline-style" iamge links only.

```diff
- before: ![helium-icon](img/icons/logowhite.svg)
+  after: ![helium-icon](img/icons/logowhite.svg)
```

Images from any folder can be used by providing path to file. Path should be relative to markdown
file.

#### Inline Style

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/icons/logoblack.svg')} />

---

### Code

- Define code language in header.
- prefix `<!-- prettier-ignore -->` to stop prettier from formatting when needed.
  - mostly rust and javascript are formatted too aggresively.

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting'
alert(s)
```

```rust
fn main() {
    // Print text to the console
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

#### Code Highlighting

You can use comments with comments to select which lines are highlighted. [Read More
here][docusaurus-code-highlighting].

- `highlight-next-line`
- `highlight-start`, and `highlight-end`

```rust
fn main() {
    // Print text to the console
    // highlight-next-line
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

---

### Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep
> writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ >
> **Markdown** into a blockquote.

---

### Inline HTML

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

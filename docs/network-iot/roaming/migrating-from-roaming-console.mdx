### Migrating from Roaming Console

If you are a roaming partner migrating from Roaming Console to the new OpenLNS Architecture, please
carefully test out your roaming connections before the full switch.

While the Roaming Console currently coexists with the OpenLNS Architecture, it is not possible to
have the same device to simultaneously send traffic to both Roaming Console and through OpenLNS
Architecture.

#### Migrating EUI Pair for Join Requests

Let's say you had 100 devices on Roaming Console, you can start the migration slowly by registering
1 EUI pair with the CLI, so that 99 of your devices will roam through Roaming Console and 1 of your
devices will roam through OpenLNS. Then, you can keep migrating, possibly registering 50 EUI pairs
with the CLI, so that 49 of your devices will roam through Roaming Console and 51 will roam through
OpenLNS. Eventually, you will have registered all 100 EUI pairs with the CLI, so that all of your
devices will roam through Roaming Console.

#### Migrating DevAddr Range for Uplinks

Let's say you have 10 DevAddrs, you can start the migration slowly by registering 1 DevAddr with the
CLI, so that 9 of your DevAddrs will roam through Roaming Console and 1 of your DevAddrs will roam
through OpenLNS. Then, you can keep migrating, possibly registering 5 DevAddrs with the CLI, so that
4 of your DevAddrs will roam through Roaming Console and 6 will roam through OpenLNS. Eventually,
you will have registered all 10 DevAddrs with the CLI, so that all of your devices will roam through
Roaming Console.

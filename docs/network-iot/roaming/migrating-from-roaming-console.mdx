Roaming users migrating from Roaming Console to the new OpenLNS architecture should carefully test
roaming connections before fully transitioning.

While Roaming Console currently coexists with the OpenLNS Architecture, it is not feasible for the
same device to simultaneously send traffic to both Roaming Console and the OpenLNS architecture.

## Migrating EUI Pair for Join Requests

Given an example, if there are 100 devices on Roaming Console, the migration can begin gradually by
registering 1 EUI pair with the CLI. This means 99 devices will roam through Roaming Console and one
device through OpenLNS. The migration can continue by registering 50 EUI pairs with the CLI, leading
to 49 devices roaming through Roaming Console and 51 through OpenLNS. Eventually, all 100 EUI pairs
will be registered with the CLI, enabling all devices to roam through OpenLNS.

## Migrating DevAddr Range for Uplinks

Similarly as an example, if there are 10 DevAddrs, the migration can start by registering 1 DevAddr
with the CLI. This results in 9 DevAddrs roaming through Roaming Console and one through OpenLNS.
Continuing the process by registering 5 DevAddrs with the CLI will lead to 4 DevAddrs roaming
through Roaming Console and 6 through OpenLNS. Ultimately, registering all 10 DevAddrs with the CLI
will enable all devices to roam through OpenLNS.

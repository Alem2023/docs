The documentation on Solana and the upcoming Migration is under development and subject to change.

:::

The migration of the Helium Network from its L1 to Solana brings several changes to the setup of the
Network and its associated subDAOs infrastructure. Chief among these changes is moving a lot of data
that has until now been on-chain (namely PoC data) off-chain.

As such, this migration introduces several Oracles which serve as bridges between the external world
and the blockchain. These infrastructure changes will allow the Helium Network to effectively
introduce new Networks as Decentralized Network Protocol (DNP) subDAOs and more easily scale
existing DNP subDAOs by removing existing bottlenecks. This document outlines the future state of
the infrastructure post-migration.
